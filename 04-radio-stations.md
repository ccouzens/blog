# Radio Stations

This is a 3rd post in a series to help remind me what to setup every time I get
a new laptop or reinstall my laptop.

These are the radio stations I listen to every now and again:

- [Bremen Eins 🇩🇪](https://rb-bremeneins-live.cast.addradio.de/rb/bremeneins/live/mp3/128/stream.mp3)
- [Scala Radio 🇬🇧🎻](https://stream-mz.planetradio.co.uk/scalahigh.aac)
- [Absolute Radio 🇬🇧](https://stream-ar.planetradio.co.uk/absoluteradiohigh.aac)
- [Absolute Classic Rock 🇬🇧](https://stream-ar.planetradio.co.uk/absoluteclassicrockhigh.aac)

I originally started listening to Bremen Eins because I thought I might pick up
German by listening to it. That hasn't happened.
