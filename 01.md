# Blog about what I'm working on

26/03/2019

For my first blog post I'll list out some of the things I am currently doing in my spare time.

## Starting a Blog

Isn't this meta üòõ?

I'm starting a blog for a few reasons.
Firstly so I can keep a record on what I'm doing, and to make it easier to reflect back and keep myself focussed.
I'm liable to get stuck or get caught up in something else and never get back to what I was doing.
I hope the blog can help keep me disciplined and organized.

Second, by having a blog, I can easily blog when I have something to blog about.
I'll have removed the initial hurdle of blogging.

Thirdly, so that I can try out static site generators.
I might try a few out if I don't get on with the first.

Fourth, so that I can practice my writing.
I don't often get a chance to write a lot.

Fifth, to design a website.
Previously my usage of HTML and CSS has always been to implement someone else's design.
This will give me an opportunity to create my own design.
It will also give me a chance to try some of the new semantic HTML5 tags and some of the CSS 3 features and CSS Level 4 features.


## Rust sudoku solver

This is something I'm thinking about.
I haven't made any concrete steps towards doing it.
I'd like to write a Sudoku solver web app in Rust.

There are probably many web apps that can already solve Sudoku, but that's not the point.
The point is so that I can try out a web assembly project.
I can try out the [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) technologies.
The front end would either be JavaScript (most probably TypeScript with React) or a native Rust DOM library.

I've written a backtracking Sudoku solver [before](https://github.com/ccouzens/newspaper-puzzle-solvers/blob/master/sudoku.py).
That was able to solve sudokus very quickly.
I expect writing in Rust, running on newer hardware and using heuristics will make this one even faster.

## React tutorial

I'm [working](https://github.com/ccouzens/react-complete-guide) [through](https://github.com/ccouzens/hamburger-react-project) a [Udemy course for React](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/v4/content).

I'd recommend it.
But as with all learning, challenge things that don't feel right.
For example, contrary to the tutorial you don't need to eject your app to set up [CSS modules](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet).

## Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a great website for getting familiar with various programming languages.
They have exercises to work through.
After doing an exercise, you can compare your solution to other people's and reflect on what you could have done better.
Some of the exercises are mentored where you receive feedback.

I'm working through the 9 different tracks, although I've not made much progress on about half of them.

Bash: Almost no progress.
I'd like to be more comfortable with Bash.
It comes up now and again.
I mostly use Bash interactively- I'm not familiar with the programming language features of Bash (eg control flow and conditions).

C: A couple exercises in.
I've written a client/server C program that sent Kinect depth data and displayed it triple buffered on the receiving end.
I started this track because C is the language that ties all other languages together.
For example Ruby extensions are written in C and many open source libraries have C headers.
I'd like to do as much of that as possible in Rust, but being familiar with C likely helps.

Elm: A couple exercises in.
This appealed to me because it's a functional language that compiles to JavaScript without inheriting all its idiosyncrasies.

Haskell: Almost no progress, but working on it.
I've done some Haskell previously and I remember it was eye opening.
I'm relearning it because I want to be able to take its pure-function philosophy into other languages.
I'm hoping that will allow me to write programs more amenable to automated tests.

Java: A couple exercises in.
I've previously struggled with Java because I perceive it as limited compared to many other languages and those limitations get in the way of nice solutions.
I'm doing the track in the hope that it might make me like Java more and as an acknowledgement that a lot of existing software is written in Java.
I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/exercism/java/pull/1643) to the track this morning.

JavaScript: 38% complete of the core exercises.
Precisely 1/3 complete on the side exercises that I've unlocked.
It's an unavoidable language, so I may as well be good at it.
It has its warts, but they've not been too difficult to work around.

Ruby: 100% complete of the core exercises.
About 30% complete on the side exercises.
The Ruby mentors are very quick to respond üëç.

I'm a professional Ruby developer.
I did this track to see if I might learn something, and I did learn a couple things.

Rust üòç: 44% complete of the core exercises.
100% of unlocked side exercises complete.

I'm loving Rust- but I think people have got tired of me advocating it so much.
I consider it a ground breaking language because it's competitive at every level of the stack.
It's competitive with C if you're writing a driver or an operating system or just want to go as fast as possible.
It's as easy (although other people might dispute) as Ruby or Python.
And it runs well in the browser.

TypeScript: 20% complete of core exercises.
About 75% complete on the unlocked side exercises.
I prefer TypeScript to JavaScript, because of the enforced discipline and the better static analysis.

TypeScript and JavaScript are a good pair to do together on Exercism.
When they have exercises in common, one solution can be used by the other with often only minor modification needed.

## Podcasts

I listen to a few Podcasts:

[Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes) - a fun podcast from RedHat and Saron Yitbarek.

[Langsam gesprochene Nachrichten](https://www.dw.com/de/deutsch-lernen/nachrichten/s-8030) - the news in German.
I subscribed in the hope that the exposure to German would improve my limited German.
To be honest, I don't think it's working.

[New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com/) - my favourite Rust podcast.

[Rusty Spike](https://rusty-spike.blubrry.net/) - Rust news.
Doesn't seem to be updated any longer.

[The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm/) - Programming podcast by thoughtbot.
The discussions are varied, but Ruby is a frequent topic.

[The Yak Shave](http://yakshave.fm/) - Programming podcast by the former hosts of the Bike Shed.
Recent topics include running crates.io and building rubyfmt.

[No such thing as a fish](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/) - This is always a treat.
Each episode 4 major facts are presented, and many more are humorously connected to it.

## Learning Haskell

I'm working through [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) (what a title!).
I'm not sure how practical Haskell is (because it's very different and not widely known), but I think learning it will teach me new ways to architect applications.

## Keycloak swagger

I want to find or create OpenApi 3 specs of [Keycloak's admin API](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/5.0/rest-api/index.html).

There are various references to Swagger in the [Pom file](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/5.0.0/services/pom.xml#L234), but I'm currently unsure how to make use of them.

Github user illes [has](https://illes.github.io/keycloak/apidocs/) [some](https://illes.github.io/keycloak/apidocs/service.json) [version](https://illes.github.io/keycloak/apidocs/Clients.json) 1 specs.
Version 1 is no longer useful, but perhaps it could be updated to a newer version.
I should contact illes to see if they can show me how they were generated.

## Sonic Mania and Spyro

The games I'm playing.

## Advent of code 2018

This is on the back-burner.
Last December I worked through some of [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) in [Rust](https://github.com/ccouzens/advent_of_code_2018_rust).
I'm intending to eventually get round to completing it.
